As a software engineer, I strive to be a continuous learner. With my main focus being cloud 
development, there always seems to be a new service, new runtime, or new API that needs to 
be integrated. So while work keeps me on my toes, I have started to enjoy teaching others as 
much as learning myself. Therefore I'm hoping that this site reaches others and teaches 
something.

Reach out on Github, LinkedIn, or Twitter below with any questions, suggestions, or improvements. 
Like I said, I'm always eager to learn - so let me know if I'm not clear and concise, can improve 
my methods, or I'm wrong.
