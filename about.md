You can see what I'm up to on my [now]({% link now.md %}) page.

I started college in 2009 at Mississippi State University. However, software engineering wasn't 
my first path of study. In fact, it wasn't even my second. But after 3 major changes, I finally 
settled on software engineering and really enjoyed all of my classes. I knew that I had made the 
right choice once I started really enjoying the work being done outside of class. I even took up 
some projects for fun. One of the biggest projects outside of school work I did was develop a tool 
called **LambdaText** with a fraternity brother. Our fraternity - Lambda Chi Alpha - needed an easy 
and cheap way to message all members various updates about dues, meetings, and other updates. This 
could be done through email or text messaging with the use of the 10 digit phone number formatted as 
an email address like `xxxxxxxxxx@txt.att.net`. My main contribution was the ability to create groups 
and add members into various groups so that different committees and teams could use the messaging 
without spamming other members.

After college, I accepted a job at thyssenkrupp elevators working on embedded control software and 
eventually developing the initial version of a device known as [MAX](max-link). I worked on the device 
that connected to the elevator control hardware and sent telemetry data to Azure's IoT Hub for 
ingestion into a large data pipeline and customer portal. During development, IoT Hub was in private 
preview so I worked closely with Microsoft engineers as they rapidly changed the interface of how 
Iot Hub worked. At one point, I was in Seattle and sat with 2 engineers to debug an issue I discovered 
with how the C SDK was reestablishing cURL connections. It was a very fast paced and fun project to 
work on. I coordinated with other engineers in Atlanta and Stuttgart, Germany to globalize the solution 
and work on thyssenkrupp's full elevator line.

After leaving thyssenkrupp, I started a job at Buckman to gain more experience on the cloud side of IoT 
deployments. Buckman is a chamical manufacturer that has customers in the paper, water, and leather 
industries. In addition to providing the needed chemicals to these customers, Buckman also collects 
data from different customer processes to be a trusted partner by monitoring, optimizing, and alerting 
on different data points. While there, I helped develop and maintain a data collection platform and customer portal that ingested thousands of data points per hour. This is where my love for cloud 
development really took off. Instead of supporting legacy, air-gapped systems that were only updated once a year, a code change I made could be deployed to all of our customers in mere minutes. I was 
hooked. I started learning and implementing more here such as feature switching, DevOps, and metrics 
gathering. I created automated pipelines to reduce deployment times from days down to minutes. I 
developed serverless applications for asynchronous tasks such as notifications. I also started learning 
Terraform and researching other infrastructure as code solutions.

It was also at Buckman that I started to gain interest in engineering leadership. It wasn't enough to 
learn new technologies, I also wanted to show others what I had learned and help them grow as well. I 
was provided with opportunities to interview and make hiring decisions. Additionally, I was given the 
chance to define a 9 rung career ladder for technical associates that went from associate engineer up 
to a senior fellow position. It was a challenge to integrate concrete skills needed to progress the 
career ladder while also leaving enough room to challenge associates to reach their full potential at 
each step. While I was faced with some tough challenges and a change in leadership, I am still 
determined that engineering leadership is the next step I want to take in my career.

I left Buckman in 2019 to take a job with a wonderful charity located here in Memphis, TN - St. Jude 
Children's Research hospital. Check out my [now]({% link now.md %}) page to see why I chose to 
accept a job here and what I work on.

If you're interested in reaching out to me, my resume is available upon request. You can find my email
