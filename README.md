# My Personal Site

Growing as a software engineer means continually learning via projects, committing to open 
source, teaching, and mentoring. I've decided to start revamping my Github profile to document 
some of my learnings with some of the things mentioned above. The first step in this is creating 
a personal site to host my resume and start a blog. This repo is just that. I've decided to learn 
a new tool along the way by creating this static site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). As I update 
this repo, I'll continually update this README as well. The end goal is this will be my first blog 
article on my personal site.
