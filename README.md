# My Personal Site

Growing as a software engineer means continually learning via projects, committing to open 
source, teaching, and mentoring. I've decided to start revamping my Github profile to document 
some of my learnings with some of the things mentioned above. The first step in this is creating 
a personal site to host my resume and start a blog. This repo is just that. I've decided to learn 
a new tool along the way by creating this static site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). As I update 
this repo, I'll continually update this README as well. The end goal is this will be my first blog 
article on my personal site. 

## Installing Jekyll

> I can't guarantee that this section will stay relevant. I am installing these tools on OS X Mojave

As I mentioned in the introduction, I have decided to learn how to create a static site with Jekyll to 
build my personal site. The first step is [installing](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) the 
tools on my computer. I currently use a Mac for development so I'll be discussing the 
[Mac OS install instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/).

2 tools are required before you start - XCode and Homebrew. Install these first to make installation go 
faster.

Since I do not use Ruby normally, I opted to install Ruby with Homebrew and point my path to that Ruby 
install. This seemed to be a quicker option and I don't foresee any issues with it at this time. I did 
install the Jekyll gem locally as suggested.

Overall, the install process went smoothly. The documentation provided by Jekyll is sufficient.
